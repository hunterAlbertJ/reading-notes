## Reading Class 01 Notes
1. How is a hardware hack different than a software hack?
  A hardware hack is different from a software hack because, outside the obvious difference in vector, it takes a lot more effort and coordination to install malicious hardware in a factory. It can also be much more destructive as the hardware itself is compromised and needs to be removed 
2. What are the two ways for spies to alter a computerâ€™s hardware?
  Spies can alter a computer's hardware either in route to the destination of the hardware or in the manufacturing process
3. Explain how the hack worked.
The chip was installed in subcontracting facilities under the threat/coercion of the people who worked there by the People's Liberation Army
4. How were investigators able to trace the chips back to the source?
The investigators were able to trace the chips back through shipping manifests, sifting through communication intercepts, tapped informants and tracking individuals through their phones.
