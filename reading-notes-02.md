1. Which is better in a CPU, more cores or higher speed? Under which circumstances is that true? How many CPU cores does a computer need?
Realistically, it depends on your application and budget when considering cores vs speed and to what degree. For most users, a balance of both with a processor with at least 4 cores will be enough for everyday tasks. In use cases of high productivity such as streaming games while playing games, a high core count is more important. An instance where core count takes precedence over clock speed would be rendering video/photos 
2. What details are you looking for when finding a motherboard that fits your processor?
  socket size specification. AM5/1700 are good examples
3. What are the tradeoffs you’d evaluate while selecting a storage device?
The main three you always consider are cost, speed, and size. Different technologies have different mixes of the three.
4. Think about others with a background similar to yours. How would you explain to them the key parts of a computer, in a way they’d best connect with?
The way I would explain the key parts of a computer to someone with a similiar background to mine would be completely different than explaining to someone who might have less experience. Having 15 years of PC building experience I would be concerned if a peer needed that kind of assistance. Jest aside, to anyone else I would use analogies to compare the major parts of the system to more commonly known dynamics. Hard drive vs RAM, Short term vs long term memory, cpu being the brain ect.
