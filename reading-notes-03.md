1. What is the BIOS?
    * The BIOS is a hardware-level first startup program that finds and loads the operating system into the RAM
2. Use analogies from your previous background to explain what happens during the booting process?
    * An analogy I would use to describe the boot process is in the Army there is someone that goes around in the morning and wakes everyone up and gets them out of their bunks to get the whole operation started
4. What is the “Power On Self Test”?
    * The POST test is the initial diagnostic test run on the hardware 
6. What is the CMOS
    * CMOS is a small battery-powered memory module that retains user settings and other information such as the time and date
6. What is the CMOS battery?
    * A battery that provides constant power to the CMOS memory module. Removing this will cause the information to be lost
## Things I want to know more about
1. What are the implications of firmware-based attacks like BIOS rootkits, and how can advanced BIOS configuration techniques such as secure boot and BIOS integrity measurement mitigate these threats?
2. How do BIOS configuration standards like the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) and ACPI influence the development and interoperability of system firmware across different hardware platforms and operating environments?
1. What is the process of reverse engineering and analyzing BIOS firmware binaries to uncover potential vulnerabilities or hidden features, and how can this knowledge be leveraged for defensive or offensive security purposes?
